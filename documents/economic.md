
**SEBI's Investigation into Gensol Engineering**

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has issued an interim order against Gensol Engineering and its promoters, Anmol and Puneet Singh Jaggi, citing serious financial misconduct. The investigation revealed that funds intended for electric vehicle procurement were diverted to purchase a ₹43 crore luxury apartment in DLF's "The Camellias" project in Gurugram.

**Key Findings:**

- **Diversion of Funds:** SEBI traced ₹42.94 crore from Capbridge Ventures LLP, where both Anmol and Puneet Singh Jaggi are designated partners, to a payment made to DLF. The apartment was initially booked in the name of the promoters' mother, Jasminder Kaur, with a ₹5 crore advance, which was later refunded and replaced by Capbridge as the final buyer.

- **Layered Transactions:** The funds originated from Gensol, passed through its vendor Go-Auto and related entities, before reaching DLF. The ₹5 crore booking advance was sourced from Gensol’s funds via multiple related parties and, once refunded by DLF, rerouted to another related entity—Matrix Gas and Renewables. SEBI stated that these transactions demonstrate layered fund flows to disguise personal asset acquisition using public company funds.

- **Broader Financial Misconduct:** Gensol borrowed over ₹977 crore from institutions like IREDA and PFC for procuring 6,400 electric vehicles but acquired only 4,704, costing ₹567.73 crore. Nearly ₹262 crore remains unaccounted for, allegedly misappropriated through Go-Auto and channeled to multiple promoter-related entities.

- **Corporate Governance Failures:** SEBI noted a complete breakdown of corporate governance at Gensol, with promoters using the company’s resources for personal expenses, including purchasing luxury real estate and engaging in speculative trading in Gensol’s own shares via Wellray Solar.

**Regulatory Actions:**

- SEBI has barred Anmol and Puneet Singh Jaggi from acting as directors or key managerial personnel in Gensol and prohibited them, along with Gensol, from trading in the securities market.

- A planned 1:10 stock split has been frozen to protect investors.

- A forensic audit has been ordered to examine financial records of Gensol and its related entities.

- SEBI also cited misleading disclosures by Gensol, including exaggerated claims of EV orders and strategic tie-ups, none of which were backed by binding contracts or financial rationale.

SEBI has warned retail investors to exercise caution, especially in light of the potential for promoters to offload remaining stakes and erode value further.
